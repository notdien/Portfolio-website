# Portfolio-website
## A page for me to display my current video-editing projects, it features an about me, a portfolio page, and also a contact form for parties to conatact me as well!

## The purpose of this page is a way for me to practice my HTML, CSS, Javascript and API skills. Everything is coded from the ground up, and no templates were used. The API was created with Postman and Nodemailer. I wanted to understand how to create a website from scratch and practice my API creating skills as well.
