            <p>
                My Name is Dien, and I am an aspiring cinematic film-maker.
                I orginally picked it up in High School after watching KevJumba's 'Home' video.
                I continued to make videos as a hobby, because it is fun and I love recording memories
                to look back in the future!
                <br>
                <br>
                I created this website to display some of my work and also look for opportunities to hone
                my film-making skills. I love creating memories with my family and friends, so I wanted to
                also help other people create these same feeling as me. This work is completely free of charge
                since I do not do this professionally, the only thing I ask for is that you be honest and be patient.
                I am a full-time student, and also work. I do this simply because it is a hobby and I enjoy creating videos!
